Northeast Investment Fund: Uncovering Inconsistencies in Brazil's National Development Open Data iniciatives 


This data was previously extracted from Brazil's governmental website http://ftp.sudene.gov.br/dados_abertos/FNE/
and cleaned by me.  

While I acknowledge that accessing specific outcomes may be challenging, assessing the inputs and allocation of resources is a crucial step in understanding the fund's functioning and potential areas of concern. By closely examining the data provided by the regional bank, we aim to identify any discrepancies, misalignments, or potential irregularities in how the fund's resources are allocated across various projects and sectors within the Northeast region. 

Extra context: 


1- What is the FNE? 
Provided with federal resources, the FNE (Northeast Development Fund) finances long-term investments and, in addition, working capital or operational costs. It covers various sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, livestock, industry, agribusiness, tourism, trade, services, culture, infrastructure, among others.
