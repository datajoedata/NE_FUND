Northeast Investment Fund: Uncovering Brazil's National Development Open Data iniciatives 



.

This data was previously extracted from Brazil's governmental website http://ftp.sudene.gov.br/dados_abertos/FNE/ 
cleaned, and translated by me.  

While I acknowledge that accessing specific outcomes may be challenging, assessing the inputs and allocation of resources is a crucial step in understanding the fund's functioning and potential areas of concern. By closely examining the data provided by the regional bank, we aim to identify any discrepancies, misalignments, or potential irregularities in how the fund's resources are allocated across various sectors within the Northeast region. 


Extra context: 


1- The Open Data Initiative of the Brazilian Government:
The Brazilian government has recognized the significant value of open data in fostering transparency, promoting accountability, and driving innovation. As a result, it has implemented an open data initiative to make government data accessible to the public. To ensure the success of the initiative, the Brazilian government has established a dedicated platform where datasets from various government agencies are published and regularly updated.

2- What is the FNE? 
Provided with federal resources, the FNE (Northeast Development Fund) finances long-term investments and, in addition, working capital or operational costs. It covers various sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, livestock, industry, agribusiness, tourism, trade, services, culture, infrastructure, among others.


3- The data contained 9005090 rows x 10 columns before splitting and it was in PT/BR. I'll upload two translated datasets, one cleaned, and one with all the errors. 

4- I've uploaded the DATASETS in the kaggle platform: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datajoedata/brazilian-northeast-fund
